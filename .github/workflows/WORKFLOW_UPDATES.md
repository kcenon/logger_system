# Workflow Updates - Phase 5 Integration Testing

## Overview
This document summarizes the GitHub Actions workflow improvements made to achieve parity with thread_system while maintaining logger_system-specific enhancements.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Workflow Added
- **dependency-security-scan.yml** (NEW)
  - Daily vulnerability scanning with Trivy
  - License compatibility checking for BSD-3-Clause
  - Dependency graph integration
  - SARIF output to GitHub Security tab
  - Checks: fmt (MIT), spdlog (MIT), gtest (BSD-3-Clause)

### 2. Coverage Workflow (coverage.yml)
#### Changes:
- Made common_system **optional** (was mandatory)
- Added conditional BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM logic
- Updated dependency installation (removed libgtest-dev, added libfmt-dev, libspdlog-dev)
- Changed from BUILD_TESTS to LOGGER_BUILD_TESTS + LOGGER_BUILD_INTEGRATION_TESTS
- Removed hardcoded LOGGER_STANDALONE_MODE and USE_THREAD_SYSTEM flags
- Added FetchContent comment for GTest
- Improved error handling with CMake log output

#### Rationale:
- Aligns with thread_system's robust optional dependency pattern
- Uses FetchContent for GTest (more portable than system packages)
- Clearer CMake configuration with proper logger_system flags

### 3. Integration Tests Workflow (integration-tests.yml)
#### Major Rewrite - Changes:
- **Added Windows support** (was Ubuntu and macOS only)
- **Added compiler matrix** for Ubuntu (GCC + Clang, was single compiler)
- **Separated jobs**: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows, coverage, performance-tests
- **Added retry logic** for apt-get operations (3 attempts with 10s delay)
- **Added FetchContent caching** for GTest dependencies
- Made common_system **optional** (was mandatory)
- Added conditional BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM logic
- **Removed** coverage-summary job (replaced with proper coverage job)
- Changed test labels from "integration" to match CTest configuration
- Added performance-tests job (conditional on workflow_dispatch or commit message)

#### New Jobs:
1. **integration-tests-ubuntu**: 4 configurations (2 build types × 2 compilers)
2. **integration-tests-macos**: 2 configurations (2 build types)
3. **integration-tests-windows**: 2 configurations (2 build types) with vcpkg
4. **coverage**: Comprehensive lcov-based coverage with Codecov upload
5. **performance-tests**: Conditional performance benchmarks

#### Rationale:
- Full cross-platform support (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Better compiler coverage (GCC + Clang on Ubuntu)
- Separation of concerns (dedicated coverage and performance jobs)
- Improved reliability with retry logic
- Better dependency caching

### 4. Static Analysis Workflow (static-analysis.yml)
#### Changes:
- Made common_system **optional** (was mandatory)
- Updated dependency installation (added libfmt-dev, libspdlog-dev)
- Simplified CMake flags to use BUILD_WITH_COMMON_SYSTEM
- Changed LOGGER_STANDALONE=ON to proper flags
- Removed NO_VCPKG flag (unnecessary)
- Applied to both clang-tidy and cppcheck jobs

#### Rationale:
- Consistency with other workflows (optional common_system)
- Uses standard project-wide CMake flags
- Maintains broader analysis scope (include/kcenon + src)

## Comparison with thread_system

### Workflows Present in Both:
| Workflow | thread_system | logger_system | Status |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| ci.yml | ✅ (277 lines) | ✅ (355 lines - MORE comprehensive) | ✅ No change needed |
| coverage.yml | ✅ (119 lines) | ✅ (102 lines → updated) | ✅ Updated |
| integration-tests.yml | ✅ (536 lines) | ✅ (154 lines → 550 lines) | ✅ Major rewrite |
| dependency-security-scan.yml | ✅ (158 lines) | ❌ → ✅ (158 lines) | ✅ Added |
| static-analysis.yml | ✅ (150 lines) | ✅ (167 lines → updated) | ✅ Updated |
| build-Doxygen.yaml | ✅ (56 lines, @v3) | ✅ (55 lines, @v4 - BETTER) | ✅ No change needed |

### Unique to logger_system:
- **benchmarks.yml**: Logger-specific benchmark automation (KEEP)
- **sanitizers.yml**: Dedicated sanitizer runs (thread_system has inline in ci.yml - KEEP)

### Key Improvements:
1. ✅ **Windows Support**: integration-tests.yml now includes Windows
2. ✅ **Compiler Matrix**: GCC + Clang testing on Ubuntu
3. ✅ **Optional Dependencies**: All workflows now treat common_system as optional
4. ✅ **Retry Logic**: Robust apt-get retry mechanism (3 attempts)
5. ✅ **FetchContent**: GTest via FetchContent instead of system packages
6. ✅ **Caching**: FetchContent dependency caching
7. ✅ **Security Scanning**: Daily vulnerability and license checks
8. ✅ **Conditional Jobs**: Performance tests only on demand or with [perf]/[bench] tags
9. ✅ **Better Error Handling**: CMake error logs on failure
10. ✅ **Consistent Flags**: Standardized CMAKE flags across all workflows

## Testing Requirements

Before merging, verify:
1. ✅ All workflows pass on feat/phase5-integration-testing branch
2. ✅ Windows builds succeed with vcpkg
3. ✅ GCC and Clang builds both pass on Ubuntu
4. ✅ Coverage report generates successfully
5. ✅ Trivy security scan completes without critical issues
6. ✅ Integration tests pass on all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)

## Migration Notes

### For Developers:
- Workflows now use `LOGGER_BUILD_TESTS=ON` and `LOGGER_BUILD_INTEGRATION_TESTS=ON`
- common_system is **optional** - builds succeed without it
- GTest is fetched automatically via FetchContent - no manual installation needed
- Performance tests require `[perf]` or `[bench]` in commit message, or manual trigger

### For CI/CD:
- New CODECOV_TOKEN secret may be needed for coverage uploads
- Trivy scans will appear in GitHub Security tab
- Workflow artifacts retained for 7-30 days depending on type

## Phase Tracking

**Current Phase**: Phase 5 - Integration Testing
**Baseline**: Phase 0 - Basic workflow setup
**Target**: 80%+ test coverage, <5 static analysis warnings per module
