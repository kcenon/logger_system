## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- **Core Logger System**: Production-ready C++20 asynchronous logging framework
  - Asynchronous processing with non-blocking log operations
  - Multiple output targets (console, file, rotating file, network, encrypted, hybrid)
  - Thread-safe operations with concurrent logging support
  - Zero-copy design for efficient message passing

- **Critical Writer**: Synchronous logging for critical messages requiring immediate write
  - Emergency flush mechanism to preserve logs during abnormal termination
  - Crash-safe logging with automatic buffer flushing

- **Advanced Architecture**:
  - Interface-driven design with ILogger, IMonitor, IMonitorable abstractions
  - Modular components with pluggable writers, filters, formatters
  - Zero circular dependencies through interface-only dependencies
  - Independent compilation without ecosystem dependencies

- **Builder Pattern API**: Fluent, type-safe logger construction
  - Configuration strategies (template-based, environment-aware, performance tuning)
  - Comprehensive validation with Result<T> error handling
  - Dependency injection for optional runtime component injection

- **CMake Build System**: Comprehensive build configuration
  - 15+ feature flags for flexible builds
  - Automatic dependency detection
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Compiler support (GCC, Clang, MSVC)

- **Writers**:
  - `console_writer`: Standard output/error stream logging
  - `file_writer`: Basic file output
  - `rotating_file_writer`: Automatic log rotation by size/time
  - `network_writer`: Remote logging over network
  - `critical_writer`: Synchronous critical message logging
  - `hybrid_writer`: Combined multiple writer support

- **Formatters**:
  - `text_formatter`: Plain text format
  - `json_formatter`: Structured JSON logging
  - `xml_formatter`: XML format for legacy systems
  - Custom formatter support via IFormatter interface

- **Filters**:
  - Log level filtering
  - Pattern-based message filtering
  - Custom filter support via IFilter interface

- **Integration Support**:
  - common_system integration (ILogger, IMonitor, Result<T> pattern)
  - thread_system integration (threading primitives, logger_interface)
  - monitoring_system integration (metrics and health monitoring via IMonitor)

- **Performance Features**:
  - Configurable batching with tunable batch sizes and queue depths
  - Lock-free operations on hot path
  - Minimal allocations with efficient memory management
  - ~15 seconds build time for independent compilation
