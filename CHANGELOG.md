## [1.0.0] - Phase 1 Foundation Complete (2025-09-09)

### Added
- **Result Pattern Error Handling** [F2]
  - Comprehensive error handling using `result<T>` and `result_void` from thread_system
  - New `error_codes.h` with detailed `logger_error_code` enum covering 20+ error conditions
  - All APIs now return result types for proper error propagation
  - Helper functions (`make_error`) for creating contextual error results
  
- **Configuration Validation Framework** [F4]
  - `logger_config.h` with comprehensive validation logic
  - Validates 15+ configuration parameters (buffer size, batch size, queue settings, etc.)
  - Predefined configuration templates:
    - `production`: Metrics enabled, crash handler, no color output
    - `debug`: Synchronous mode, immediate output, trace level
    - `high_performance`: 64KB buffer, lock-free queue, compression
    - `low_latency`: 10ms flush interval, small batches
  - All configurations validated before logger instantiation
  
- **Builder Pattern Implementation** [F4]
  - `logger_builder.h` with fluent interface for logger construction
  - Automatic configuration validation before build
  - Template support via `use_template()` method
  - Method chaining for intuitive API usage
  - Validates writer count against configuration limits
  
- **Interface Segregation (SOLID)** [F3]

    - `log_filter_interface`: Filter abstraction for log filtering
    - `log_formatter_interface`: Formatting contract for output formatting
    - `log_sink_interface`: Output sink abstraction
  - Unified `log_entry` structure for consistent data passing

  - Interface implementation tests
  - All tests passing (100% success rate)

### Changed
- **Thread System Integration** [F1]

  - Added conditional compilation (`USE_THREAD_SYSTEM` / `LOGGER_STANDALONE`)
  - CMake automatically detects sibling thread_system project
  - Seamless integration when thread_system is available
  
- **API Improvements**
  - All log operations return `result_void` for error handling
  - Writer operations return results for error propagation
  - Filter/formatter interfaces use const-correct signatures
  - Updated all 10+ implementation files for new signatures
  - Maintained backward compatibility with wrapper methods

### Fixed
- Compilation errors with thread_system result type access
- Error code mapping between logger and thread domains (10000 offset)
- CMake dependency resolution for sibling projects
- Result type method access (`error()` â†’ `get_error()`)
